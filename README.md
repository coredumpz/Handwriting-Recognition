# Handwriting-Recognition

* Problem

In real life, usually understanding of someone’s handwriting might be a challenging problem and converting documents on papers to digital environment is necessary but it is not efficient without using a third-party software.

* Aim of the Project

Our aim on this project is to reduce unnecessary time consumption and labor force. Also, our main purpose is to prevent undesirable human mistakes that can occur on written 
communication. And on doing so minimizing the error that might happen on conversion of documents to digital environment.

* Solution to the Problem

Our solution to this problem is constructing a model based on artificial intelligence that consist of convolutional neural network and computer vision.  The model must be trained 
with substantial and appropriate data. We decided that EMNIST dataset is more suitable for our model with help of TensorFlow and Keras libraries.
